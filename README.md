## A2A + MCP + LangChain = Powerful Multi-Agent Financial Analysis Chatbot!
We're building a multi-agent financial analysis system where different AI agents work together to provide comprehensive stock market insights. 
Think of it like assembling a team of specialists:
- Financial Expert Agent (gives advice and analysis)
- Data Fetcher Agent (gets current stock prices)
- News Agent (finds latest financial news)
- Coordinator Agent (orchestrates everything)

### The Architecture: Three Main Components
#### 1. A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol:
What it is: A way for AI agents to talk to each other
Why we need it: Instead of one big AI doing everything, we have specialists
Real-world analogy: Like having a financial advisor who can call a data analyst or news reporter when needed

#### 2. MCP (Model Context Protocol):
What it is: A way to give AI agents specific tools/functions
Why we need it: Our agents need to DO things (fetch data, scrape news)
Real-world analogy: Like giving your assistant access to specific databases and websites

#### 3. LangChain Integration:
What it is: A framework that coordinates multiple AI agents and tools
Why we need it: It makes all the agents work together smoothly
Real-world analogy: Like a project manager coordinating different departments
